# Ninjin Entities

An entities mod for DBC 1.4.72.

This mod was created by me (Hedaox). This is a simple but very complete mod that add hundreds of new NPCs in the DBC mod made by Jinryuu (Now the mod is developped by his brother Ben). Here his website : http://main.jingames.net/.
Special thanks to FinTheHuman and JakeTheDog, without whom the Movie saga would not have come out.

Here a video showing all current NPCs from the Main saga added by this mod : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVOn6NEMpUA

The NPCs use the DBC AI meaning that they can fly and use Ki Attack. Each entity has his own set of ki attacks with different colors. Also some of them have an aura ! Can be normal, lightning or god. Also some of the NPCs are "trainers", this mean that they won't kill you if they beat you, instead they will put you into a KO state. 

You can use the "/summonninjin ninjinentities.\<EntityName\>" to summon the NPCs. Use "TAB" to auto complete the command.

# Saga files

You also can use my personal MainDBC.json and MoviesDBC.json for having an already made main and movie saga with this mod : https://github.com/Hedaox/ninjinentities/releases/download/1.2.7.2/SagaFiles.zip

In the zip file there is two language directory at the moment : "En"(English) and "Fr"(French). You can send me saga in other translated language, I will add them in the zip. Then inside a language directory you will find two directory, inside each of them you can find the Main saga and Movie Saga json files. In the directory named "TPs", you can find two sagas that will give you TPs and alignment at the end of each of the quests. the "normal" directory won't give you any TPs or alignment. Also a config file : "jinryuujrmcore.cfg" is inside the "Config" directory. I recommend this config with this mod. You will have to put the sagas files in the "world/data/missions" folder, and the config file in ".minecraft/config".

To start the main saga in game just press "L" (by default). Then follow instructions. For the movie saga you just have to press the same button then go to "Side".
