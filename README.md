# Ninjin Entities

An entities mod for DBC 1.4.68. (Should work with 1.4.70, tell me if it doesn't)

This mod was created by me (Hedaox). This is a simple but very complete mod that add hundreds of new NPCs in the DBC mod made by Jinryuu (Now the mod is developped by his brother Ben). Here his website : http://main.jingames.net/.

Here a video showing all current NPCs added by this mod : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVOn6NEMpUA

The NPCs use the DBC AI meaning that they can fly and use Ki Attack. Also with the last version of DBC some of them have now an aura ! Also some of the NPCs are "trainers", this mean that they won't kill you if they beat you, instead they will put you into a KO state. 

# Saga files

You also can use my personal MainDBC.json for having an already made saga with this mod : https://github.com/Hedaox/ninjinentities/releases/download/1.1.1.0/SagaFiles.zip

In the rar file you can found two Saga folders, inside the first one, the saga will give you TPs and alignment at the end of the quests and the other won't. There is two translated version for the moment: English and French (you can send me saga in other translated language, I will add them in the rar). Also a config file is inside, that I recommend for using with this mod. You will have to put the saga file in the "world/data/missions" folder, and the config file in ".minecraft/config".
